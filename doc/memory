Memory in the compiler
======================

Conventionally, when a resource is acquired it also has to be free'd. Some
general rules need to be layed out in order to ensure sanity when working
with C malloc/free.

1. When a function returns a pointer to a structure, a struct_name_free
   function must be provided which will also free() the whole structure,
   including the contents.

   For example, a `struct options` will have a `options_free` functions
   where the opts struct will be free'd.
