mcc
===

Mocha compiler. Used for building & linking mocha programs, but also works for
regular C code with the use of external compilers like gcc or clang. mcc is
seperated from the mocha language repository, because it is really a project
of its own. The goal of mcc is to compile mocha source code, it does not
provide a user-friendly interface for libraries or joining programs, which
should be done with a package manager tool.

Use `make && make install` to build & install the compiler. Remember to run the
install step as root.

If you are an end user of mocha, use the package manager instead. If you know
what you are doing, see `mcc --help` for more info.
